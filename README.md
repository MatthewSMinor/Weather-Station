# Weather-Station
This is the code for our Arduino Weather Station still in progress. We hope to in future, add design sheets and instructions 
for anyone wanting to make a similar product.

# Issues that have been overcome
* Wiring multiple sensors with limited power supply.
* Formatting and converting sensor reading into desired format. 
* Finding and utalizing libraries that gave specific readouts that we were looking for.
